	* Updates: 10m
		* Brad: WiFi working on ESP32---connecting + HTTP requests, logic is mostly in userspace, but works none-the-less
		* Phil: Huawei agreed to fund network security that Hudson + Phil working on
		* Amit: board admin in the repo
		* Pat: would be good to have a list of boards with support table for each
			* Maybe in the wiki
			* Would avoid having pointers to non-master boards lost forever
	* Generalizing the Radio HIL
		* Resources:
			* HIL: https://github.com/tock/tock/blob/master/kernel/src/hil/radio.
			* PR that raised the issue:
		* Brief summary:
			* A bunch of RF233 specific details in the HIL. Totally needs to be cleaned up.
				* E.g. SPI message for RF233 structure is basically part of the HIL
				* Hudson: Daniel responded recently that he's been able to hack together a port with the existing HIL
			* Other substantive change, that's  not as good:
				* removes buffer management
				* rather than passing in buffers in board initialization, global buffers are referenced unsafely
				* but initialization indeed should be radio-specific, not in the HIL
			* Hudson: still need a HIL for multi-protocol radios
	* Driver logic ISRs: the good, the bad, and  the ugly
