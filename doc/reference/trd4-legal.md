Abstract
--------

This document describes Tock’s policy on licensing and copyright. It explains
the rationale behind the license selection (dual-license, MIT or Apache2) and
copyright policy (optional, and authors may retain copyright if desired). It
further outlines how licensing and copyright shall be handled throughout
projects under the Tock umbrella.

Explicitly not discussed in this TRD are issues of trademark, the Tock brand,
logos, or other non-code assets and artifacts.


1 Introduction
==============

Tock’s goal is to provide a safe, secure, and efficient operating system for
microcontroller-class devices. The Tock project further believes it is
important to enable and support widespread adoption of safe, secure, and
efficient software. Tock also seeks to be an open and inclusive project, and
Tock welcomes contributions from any individuals or entities wishing to
improve the safety, security, reliability, efficiency, or usability of Tock
and the Tock ecosystem.

The intent of these policies is to best satisfy the needs of all stakeholders
in the Tock ecosystem.


2 Licensing
===========

All software artifacts under the umbrella of the Tock project are
dual-licensed as Apache License, Version 2.0 (LICENSE-APACHE or
http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) or MIT license (LICENSE-MIT or
http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

All contributions to the Tock kernel (the code hosted at
https://github.com/tock/tock) MUST be licensed under these terms.


3 Copyright
===========

Entities contributing resources to open-source projects often require
attribution to recognize their efforts. Copyright notices are a common means to
provide this. For downstream users, the license terms of Tock ensures
unencumbered use.

Copyrights in Tock projects are retained by their contributors. No
copyright assignment is required to contribute to Tock projects.

Artifacts in the Tock project MAY include explicit copyright notices.
Substantial updates to an artifact MAY add additional copyright notices to an
artifact. In general, modifications to a file are expected to retain existing
copyright notices.

For full authorship information, see the version control history.


4 Implementation
================

Where possible, all textual files that allow comments MUST include a license
notice and copyright notice(s). Files that are not authored by Tock contributors
(such as files copied from other projects) are exempt from this policy.

Copyright notices SHOULD include a year. Newer copyright notices SHOULD be
placed after existing copyright notices. If non-trivial updates are performed by
an original copyright author, they MAY amend the year(s) indicated on their
existing copyright statement or MAY add an additional copyright line, at their
discretion.


4.1 Format
----------

License and copyright information SHOULD have at least one (1) blank line
separating it from any other content in the file.

Text described in this section SHOULD be pre-fixed or post-fixed with
technically necessary characters (i.e. to mark as a comment in source
code) as appropriate.

The first line of license text SHOULD appear as-follows:

> Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 or the MIT License.

The second line of license SHOULD adhere to the [SPDX](https://spdx.dev)
specification for license description. As of this writing, it SHOULD
appear as-follows:

> SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0 OR MIT

The [current (v2.3) normative
rules](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/SPDX-license-expressions/) permit
case-insensitive matches of the license identifier but require case-sensitive
matching of the disjunction operator. To simplify enforcement of licensing and
documentation rules, license information SHOULD preserve case as-shown in the
SPDX license list (i.e. as-presented above).

Copyright lines SHOULD follow this pattern:

> Copyright {entity} {year}([,year],[-year]).

The `{entity}` field should reflect the entity wishing to claim copyright. The
`{year}` field SHOULD reflect when the copyright is first established.
Substantial updates in the future MAY indicate renewed copyright, via additional
comma-separated years or via range syntax, at the copyright holder’s discretion.
The initial year SHALL NOT be removed unless it is the express intent of the
copyright holder to relinquish the initial copyright.


### 4.1.1 Examples

The common-case format is:

```rust
// Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 or the MIT License.
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0 OR MIT
// Copyright Tock Contributors <YYYY>.

//! Module-level documentation...
```

placed at the top of the file.

If you wish to specifically call out the contribution by you or your company,
you may do so by adding another copyright line:

```rust
// Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 or the MIT License.
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0 OR MIT
// Copyright Tock Contributors <YYYY>.
// Copyright <you/your company> <YYYY>.

//! Module-level documentation...
```

A file with a long history and multiple copyrights may look as follows:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 or the MIT License.
# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0 OR MIT
# Copyright Tock Contributors 2014.
# Copyright Pat Pannuto 2014,2016-2018,2021.
# Copyright Amit Levy 2016-2019.
# Copyright Bradford James Campbell 2022.

set -e
...
```

Many additional examples are available throughout the Tock repositories.


4.2 Enforcement
---------------

To ensure coverage and compliance with these policies, the Core Team
SHALL author and maintain tooling which checks the presence and expected
format of license and copyright information. This SHOULD be automated and
integrated with continuous integration systems. Contributions which do
not satisfy these license and copyright rules MUST NOT be accepted.

In exceptional situations, consensus from the Core Team MAY circumvent
this policy. Such situations MUST include public explanation and public
record of non-anonymized vote results. This is not expected to ever occur.
