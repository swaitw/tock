# CAN

## Overview
The CAN capsule allows the user to send and receive asynchronous messages on the CAN bus.
The user must set the bitrate and operation mode of the peripheral before turning it on.
After the device was enabled, the communication parameters cannot be modified without
turning it off beforehand. The capsule can be controlled by the userspace using 10
different commands.

The userspace will be notified by the capsule when a message is sent and received and
when the device was enabled and disabled. For the send command, there is a read-only
shared buffer, and for the receive command, the kernel communicates with the userspace
using a read-write buffer.

## Command

  * ### Command number: `0`
	
	  **Description**: Does the driver exist?

	  **Argument 1**: unused

	  **Argument 2**: unused

	  **Returns**: Success if it exists, otherwise NODEVICE

  * ### Command number: `1`

	  **Description**: Set the bitrate for the CAN peripheral. This will calculate all the
		timing parameters for the device. This command must be sent before enabling the device.

	  **Argument 1**: The bitrate value for the CAN communication.

	  **Argument 2**: unused

	  **Returns**: Ok(()) if the bitrate value is correct, otherwise INVAL if the value is_enabled
		incorrect or if the timing parameters could not be correctly calculated or BUSY if the device
		was previously enabled and is running. 

  * ### Command number: `2`

	  **Description**: Set the operation mode of the CAN peripheral. This command must be 
		sent before enabling the device.

	  **Argument 1**: The operation mode that can be Loopback, Monitoring, Freeze or Normal.

	  **Argument 2**: unused

	  **Returns**: Ok(()) if the operaton value is correct, otherwise BUSY if the device
		was previously enabled and is running.

  * ### Command number: `3`

	  **Description**: Enable the device. Previously, the bitrate and the operation mode
		must pe set.

	  **Argument 1**: unused

	  **Argument 2**: unused

	  **Returns**: Ok(()) if the enable process of the device worked, otherwise ALREADY if the device
		was previously enabled and is running, RESERVE if there is another application that is
		using the capsule or FAIL if the peripheral is in an error state/

	  **Additional notes:** After this command, the userspace must wait after 2 callbacks: the `state_changed` that sends
		to the capsule the state of the device, and the `enabled` callback that confirms that the enable
		process was successful.

  * ### Command number: `4`

	  **Description**: Disable the device. Previously, the device must be enabled.

	  **Argument 1**: unused

	  **Argument 2**: unused

	  **Returns**: Ok(()) if the disable process of the device worked, otherwise BUSY if the device
		was already disabled or RESERVE if there is another application that is using the capsule.

	  **Additional notes:** After this command, the userspace must wait after 2 callbacks: the `state_changed` that sends
		to the capsule the state of the device, and the `disable` callback that confirms that the disable
		process was successful.

  * ### Command number: `5`

	  **Description**: Send a message with a standard identifier. Previously, the device must be enabled.

	  **Argument 1**: the 16-bit identifier for the transmission.

	  **Argument 2**: the length of the message.

	  **Returns**: Ok(()) if the message could be sent, otherwise NOMEM if the message could not be
		accessed, RESERVE if there is another application that is using the capsule or OFF is the device
		is not enabled.

	  **Additional notes:** After this command, the userspace must wait after the `transmit_complete` callback that returns
		to the capsule the buffer used for the data transfer between the driver and the capsule.
	
  * ### Command number: `6`

	  **Description**: Send a message with an extended identifier. Previously, the device must be enabled.

	  **Argument 1**: the 32-bit identifier for the transmission.

	  **Argument 2**: the length of the message.

	  **Returns**: Ok(()) if the message could be sent, otherwise NOMEM if the message could not be
		accessed, RESERVE if there is another application that is using the capsule or OFF is the device
		is not enabled.

	  **Additional notes:** After this command, the userspace must wait after the `transmit_complete` callback that returns
		to the capsule the buffer used for the data transfer between the driver and the capsule.

  * ### Command number: `7`

	  **Description**: Sends to the driver the command to start listening for messages on the CAN
		bus. This will also configure filters so that any message can be received. Previously, the 
		device must be enabled.

	  **Argument 1**: unused

	  **Argument 2**: unused

	  **Returns**: Ok(()) if the device is ready to receive messages, otherwise OFF is the device
		is not enabled, NOMEM if the buffer in which data should be saved cannot be accessed, SIZE 
		if the buffer in which data should be saved cannot store more than 2 messages.

	  **Additional notes:** After this command, the userspace must wait after the `message_received` callback that returns
		to the capsule a reference of the buffer used for the data transfer between the driver and the capsule.
		The capsule must make a copy of the data because is does not own the buffer.

  * ### Command number: `8`

	  **Description**: Sends to the driver the command to stop listening for messages on the CAN
		bus. This will also disable the filters that were previously enabled. Previously, the 
		device must be enabled.

	  **Argument 1**: unused

	  **Argument 2**: unused

	  **Returns**: Ok(()) if the device was stopped from receiving messages, otherwise OFF is the device
		is not enabled, and FAIL if the buffer that was used to store messages cannot be owned by the
		capsule after begin owned by the driver.

	  **Additional notes:** After this command, the userspace must wait after the `stopped` callback that returns
		to the capsule the buffer used for the data transfer between the driver and the capsule.
		The capsule owns now the buffer.

  * ### Command number: `9`

	  **Description**: Set the timing parameters for the CAN peripheral. This command must be 
		sent before enabling the device.

	  **Argument 1**: An integer that has on each byte one timing parameter (as the parameters
		can be represented using 8 bits): time_segment1, time_segment2, synchronization_jump_width
		and the baud_rate_prescaler.

	  **Argument 1 format**:
	
        ```
        0              8               16                24                   32
