The [Particle_Boron](https://docs.particle.io/reference/datasheets/b-series/boron-datasheet/) is development board based on the `nRF52840 SOC`. "The Boron is a powerful LTE Cat M1 or 2G/3G enabled development kit that supports cellular networks and Bluetooth LE (BLE). It is based on the Nordic nRF52840 and has built-in battery charging circuitry so itâ€™s easy to connect a Li-Po and deploy your local network in minutes."

To program the [Particle_Boron](https://docs.particle.io/reference/datasheets/b-series/boron-datasheet/) with Tock, you will need a JLink JTAG device and the
appropriate cables.

Then, follow the [Tock Getting Started guide](../../../doc/Getting_Started.md)

## Programming the kernel

Once you have all software installed, you should be able to simply run
`make install` in this directory to install a fresh kernel. Make sure to install 
the [tockloader](https://github.com/tock/tockloader).

## Hardware Setup

Required: 

* Segger JLink 
* USB Cable for power & Debugging
* FDTI/Serial UART converter (Optional for debugging/Console)

Ensure JLink is connected and the Particle Boron is powered using either mUSB cable or a Li-Po battery. 

## Software Setup

To flash using JLink, make sure the segger software is installed on your machine. See [here](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink). You can test that it is installed properly by running the following command. 

```bash
$ JLinkExe
```

## Programming user-level applications

You can program an application via JTAG using `tockloader`: 
 
First clone libtock-c, more instructions [here](https://github.com/tock/libtock-c).

Note: We currently use the `nrf52dk` (until tockloader supports) board alias for the Particle Boron to flash using the tockloader. 

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:tock/libtock-c.git  
$ cd libtock-c/examples/<app>
$ make
$ tockloader install --board nrf52dk --jlink blink/build/blink.tab
```
You should see the rgb-led light show on the board now!

## Board Reset

A reset on the baord can be performed by the **_RESET** push button, to reboot the kernel. 

## Console output

Console is interfaced with UART. On the left side of the Particle Boron, you can see the marked UART RX/TX pins. Connect a serial converter to the appropriate pins (`UART1_RX->CONVERTER_TX` & `UART1_TX->CONVERTER_RX`), see the figure above for the pin-out.

If you are on a linux machine, it's a good idea to monitor the kernel message buffer with `dmesg -w` when plugging the serial converter in. This can quickly tell us which USB device to open.

```bash
$ dmesg -w

[26244.142183] usb 3-4: new full-speed USB device number 50 using xhci_hcd

[26244.309214] usb 3-4: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB0
```
Based on the last kernel message, we are mapped to `ttyUSB0`, now, we can access the console with:
```bash
$ screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
.
..
Particle Boron: Initialization complete. Entering main loop
tock$
```

OR

```bash
$ tockloader listen
.
.
.
