# Post commit statuses to github indicating how a PR affects flash and RAM use for different boards.

# This script also prints more detailed size analysis to the Travis build log.
# This script only reports updates for boards whose size have changed as a result of the PR being
# tested, and does not currently support analyzing size differences in RISC-V boards.
# This file relies on a travis environment variable to post to github, which is the value of a
